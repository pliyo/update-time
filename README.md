# UpdateTime
This will provide a script that will update the time in your windows machine.

I needed to do this because I was facing a BIOS problem so my clock was getting out of date from time to time, giving me plenty of headaches. There are loads of monitoring tool such as Application Insights or Grafana that will use your computer clock when doing searchs as well as authorization problems that may rise. With this my problems got fixed, I just need to run the script.

To run this you'll need admin rights.
